# ngelectron-explorer

A file explorer built on AngularJS and Electron with a fresh yet familiar look.

[Here](https://trello.com/b/fLIo7Tk1) is the public trello board for the application.

**Note:** The app starts at **C:/** by default, something that'll be updated soon. It is still super early in development and you might see more bugs than features. If you do notice any, raise an issue and let me know. Even better, let's fix it!
